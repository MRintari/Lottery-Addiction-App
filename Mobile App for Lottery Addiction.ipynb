    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "In this project, I will be developing the logic for a mobile app that helps lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The app will focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will use data from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has data for 3,655 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.\n",
